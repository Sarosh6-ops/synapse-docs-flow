KMRL Synapse ðŸš†âœ¨
Intelligent Document Management for Modern Transit Systems
Built for the Smart India Hackathon

Live Demo: 

The Problem
Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is overwhelmed by a massive and diverse volume of daily documentsâ€”from engineering drawings and vendor invoices to safety circulars and HR policies. This information overload creates a "silent productivity tax," leading to delayed decisions, departmental silos, compliance risks, and duplicated work.

Our Solution
KMRL Synapse is a modern, AI-powered web application designed to solve this problem. It acts as a central nervous system for the organization, ingesting any document and transforming it into a clean, personalized, and actionable intelligence feed for every employee.

Instead of digging through emails, an engineer or manager gets an instant, AI-generated summary of what's important to them, enabling faster decisions and seamless collaboration.

Key Features
ðŸ§  AI-Powered Analysis: Upload any document (PDF, DOCX) and instantly receive a concise summary, a list of key action items, and urgent alerts generated by Google's Gemini AI.

ðŸ§¾ Intelligent Invoice Parsing: Upload an invoice image and the system uses OCR to automatically extract structured data like invoice number, vendor name, and total amount.

ðŸ’¬ Real-time Collaboration Hub: A built-in chat allows departments to instantly discuss new documents and insights, breaking down communication silos.

ðŸ“Š Analytics Dashboard: A visual dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of document flow, processing status, and key metrics.
